# Isolation Distributional Kernel (IDK) Algorithm

This repository is dedicated to experimenting with the Isolation Distributional Kernel (IDK) algorithm for measuring the similarity between signals.

## Overview

The Isolation Distributional Kernel (IDK) algorithm is utilized to compare two time series signals and generate a similarity score based on their similarities.
